	It is a massive undertaking, your feet digging grooves into the ground as you fight the $npc1.species's inertia. Your jaws strain as you engulf the $npc1.species's flabby head and neck. Your stomach grumbles in anticipation of the feast, causing you to drool copiously. You slowly and agonizingly work your way across the chest and around the gut, your lips making a deep groove in $npc1.his adipose.

As you get your jaws around the widest part, gravity takes over and causes the $npc1.species to surge into your mouth, knocking you onto your rump as you no longer need to pull the bear in. As your jaws close around $npc1.his feet, you lay back down to rest, giving one final swallow to curl $npc1.him in your gut, which heaves up and down as you breathe like the $npc1.species's did.

You find yourself rolling onto your back, pinned underneath the weight. Your frantic motions generate less and less of an effect, until even all of your might doesn’t cause even a ripple through your bloated frame. You are helpless to listen to the Dryad chant and watch as you grow larger and larger with each passing moment, your $p.fur becoming completely blue. When your waist is $waist, you finally pass out from the pressure.

you feel yourself swelling even more, weighing you down and making every move difficult. You find yourself soft of breath, your sagging arms and legs sweating as their load only grow greater with every moment. Even as you try to make your next move, your limb rebel, and you sag onto your back like a bloated water balloon, panting as your frame continues to spread. Even as you try to muster the energy to try and move, any attempt just leaves you lightheaded and panting. You are helpless to listen to the Dryad chant watch as your body continues to bloat outward, your $p.fur becoming completely blue.

As your last attack hits, the dryad stumbles, her song coming to an abrupt end as she grasps at her wound. She looks at you briefly, anger blazing in her eyes, before she turns toward the nearest tree and sprints gracefully into it. She slides into it as effortlessly as if it was air and is gone without a trace. You begin to feel somewhat normal again as the last of the dryad's words fade from your mind. You look at yourself and see the color staining your $p.fur starting to fade as your swelling subsides. Within a few moments you're back to you original shade of $p.furBelly.

<p>As you begin to regain consciousness, you become aware of an extremely bloated sensation all over. As you try to shift, you can only feel the sensation of muscle working, but you get no sense of motion out of any part of your body. You are almost afraid to open your eyes, but realize that there is no escaping it. As color floods back into the world, you notice an overwhelming amount of blue. You are confused for a moment before you realize that what you are looking at is yourself. </p>

<p>You don’t recognize yourself, as you resemble little more then an enormous blimp. Every feature about you is bloated beyond anything you thought capable. Your cheeks resemble beach balls for all their size. Your hands and fingers are thick little balls incapable of movement, and your arms and legs are little more than tires half swallowed up by your enormously round body. Your stomach and chest have blown outward, until they are spherical in nature, encasing your limbs in a vice-like grip which makes any attempt at motion an impossibility. Honestly with your vibrant blue hue, you resemble a giant piece of fruit more then anything else. You attempt a shout, but only get a muffled mumble, your head too bloated to talk, let alone make such a yell. </p>

<p>Your eyes dart about, for the first time taking in your surroundings after the shock of finding yourself in this state. Wherever you are, it seems very green. There are trees plants and vines everywhere, though the configuration seem a little more structured then one would expect from wild undergrowth. The vines above form a natural cathedral ceiling, trees acting as pillars, while their roots carpet the ground, forming tiers around the central feature of the area. The middle of the cathedral is a pit that all the roots and vines seem to gravitate towards. How deep it is you can’t tell, as it is filled with some sort of multi-colored liquid that swirls about in different shades of the rainbow. </p>

You're also not the only one here. Littered about, you see a number of giant fruit-like spheres of different colors. You suddenly realize you’re not the only one who has ended up in this predicament. Everyone seems to be at different stages of bloat. You see a $npc2.species that seems halfway full, gut spreading outward over the ground like a water balloon with short limbs wobbling helplessly, while others, like you are little more then rounded balls. Then there are the Dryads, many of them wandering about and inspecting their 'harvest' of helpless fruit people. Occasionally, you see them singing to a fur, and watch them slowly fill out. 
<br><br>

Then you see the dryad that you had faced, inspecting you. "You look about ripe," she says, before she begins chanting once more. 
<br><br>

As the chanting begins again, you feel the pressure in you intensify, as if it could get any worse, and your features swell even more, swallowing up your limbs and almost swallowing your face in the folds of your cheeks. That is not the only thing happening, as the vines in the ceiling come alive, snaking their way through the air towards you, encircling you and lifting you even as you bloat outward, your insides sloshing violently. 
<br><br>

<<if $options.popping>>
It carries you toward the center pit, holding you there as the pressure in you builds tremendously. You feel a gurgle in the pit of your stomach, and a strange stretching sound like an overfilled balloon. Your cheeks start enveloping your head as you feel liquid rising from your throat. You taste juice as it begins dribbling from your mouth and nose, even as you begin tearing up, you see the same color flowing from your tear ducts. 
<br><br>

The pressure surges even more, and the flow of juice from your orifices, intensifies, as your body swells outwards one last time, and the vines drop you. You fall, your body suddenly springing leaks, juice spraying violently before you hit the surface of the juice filled pit, exploding in a tsunami of juice like a water balloon. 
<<else>>
It carries you toward the center pit, wrapping around you again and again before tilting you towards the pit, where you can see the colored liquid swirling. You pick up a sweet fruity smell, and recognize it as juice. Your view suddenly becomes blocked as your swelling body envelops your head, and just as you think you are about to burst, the vines start squeezing. 
<br><br>

The vines around your middle start tightening, both ends of you bulging as your inside are force both ways. You feel the pressure building even more, before the vine at you bottom end start tightening as well, forcing everything one way towards your top end. You feel a surge of liquid flowing outwards, and finally, it erupts from your mouth like a geyser, shooting into the pit like a fire hose of blue water. You taste a huge amount of fruit juice as it if forced out of your body, the vines constricting gradually as you feel the unbearable internal pressure lesson slowly. Like a deflating balloon, your body sags and shrinks, slowly starting to regain some of its features. And the vines squeeze more and more out of you, juicing you until the flow starts to recede, first to a slow stream, then a trickle. Finally, only a few drops fall from your mouth, even as the vines shake you downward. Seemingly satisfied, it deposits you onto the ground, disorientated and shaking on the ground nearby. 
<br><br>

Exhausted, you fall over and pass out.
