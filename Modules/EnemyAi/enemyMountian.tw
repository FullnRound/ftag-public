This anthropomorphic $npc1.color $npc1.species is tremendously large, far bigger than what is naturally possible, and sports both a gigantic musculature and a massively round belly. $npc1.He is looking at you with hunger in $npc1.his eyes, and a malicious grin upon $npc1.his face.

Fat melts off of your form as the tendrils drift out of you and into the body of the huge $npc1.species, who lets out a snarl as $npc1.his thick bulk expands, muscles swelling and belly ballooning even larger. The tendrils cease to emanate from you, leaving you fatless, before you are slowly lowered back to the ground and control returns to your body. The $npc1.species growls, flexing significantly stronger muscles and looming a bit larger than before...

			You are suspended in the air, unable to move, as bright red tendrils emanate from your body. Your body seems to melt away, rapidly shrinking to fatlessness as the tendrils drift out of you and into the body of the huge $npc1.species. $npc1.He flinches, $npc1.his body shaking as it grows, muscles bulging thicker and $npc1.his belly swelling and redoubling in size. When the tendrils finally cease to flow from you, you are lowered to the floor and control returns to your body. The $npc1.species throws $npc1.his head back and lets out a roar, stretching $npc1.his massively thickened limbs before returning $npc1.his attention to you...

When the tendrils finally stop flowing from you, you are lowered slowly to the floor and control returns to your body. For a brief moment, the $npc1.species looks immensely pleased with $npc1.his now monstrous bulk, but $npc1.his smile suddenly becomes a shocked grimace, and $npc1.he lowers himself to a seat, moaning loudly and placing $npc1.his huge $npc1.hands on $npc1.his over-stuffed belly...

As you do, you can see a bright flash of various color at the peripherals of your vision, but are fortunately unaffected.

						The $npc1.species suddenly holds a $npc1.hand out, palm up, towards you. Your eyes are drawn to a prismatic, glowing orb that levitates above $npc1.his grasp, and you are dazzled when it suddenly bursts into an array of lights and shapes.

"Then you will serve me before I consume you," $npc1.he rumbles. Your thoughts and fears fall away as new strength fills you, and you are left in rapture at the notion of serving your new master.

"Stop fighting," $npc1.he commands, and the words ring and echo in your mind. For a moment, you resist, but soon find yourself unable to disobey. You go limp under $npc1.his grasp, and everything seems to go hazy... Thoroughly beaten and drained of the ability to fight further, you slump to the ground in a heap, only to find yourself picked up by the massive beast of a $npc1.species. "You will be a meal to me, weak little creature, but first, you will do my bidding," $npc1.he rumbles, putting a $npc1.hand to your head. Your thoughts and fears fade away, and you can feel your strength return to you. After a few more moments, you are filled with rapture at the notion of serving this titanic beast, and then the world becomes a bit of a blur.

The $npc1.species lets out an anguished roar, arcane red energy leaking out in whisps from $npc1.his battered form, causing him to shrink considerably. Some of the energy flows back into your body, returning you to your original state. As $npc1.he lowers to the floor, $npc1.he groans out, "I can't be bested here, Master." Looking up from the floor, $npc1.he snarls at you. "I'll have my revenge. I'm not done with you, I swear it!" For a moment it appears $npc1.he continues to shrink, but it quickly becomes apparent that $npc1.he is turning into some sort of grey ooze. The viscous fluid flows into cracks in the cavern walls, retreating from you, and as the magical barrier fades away, you are left alone in the chamber with the magical container you were sent to retrieve.

Your struggles prove fruitless as you simply can't get the leverage you need to escape, and as your hips enter its stretched throat, you begin to slide down its wet insides to its dark and cramped stomach.

Your stomach stretches and swells as you engorge yourself, forced to slow down to nearly a halt as you swallow at its massive gut. Inch by inch, you slide it steadily further into your stretched form, finally gulping down its tremendous belly. Pulling yourself forward as much as you drag it into your mouth, the creature raises its wings in a desperate attempt to resist, but you've come too far to be stopped by this point. You grasp its arms, shoving them into your mouth and swallowing down, your hungry gullet overpowering even its mighty wings. Your belly is massively stretched even before you suck down its long, thick neck, and you are tremendously stretched by the time it is forced into a ball inside your enormous gut.

Determined, you slowly work it into your stretched throat, painfully aware of its twitching tail poking around in your belly. You manage to fit it into your throat, but as the $npc1.species is sliding inextricably into your gullet, you already know that you've made a mistake. You can't stop yourself from swallowing the beast down even as your stomach grows and grows from its bulk. It lets out an angry roar, seemingly aware that it's too much for you. As its long, thick neck slips into your throat, you can feel the beast growling as a painful vibrating through your body. As you lie on your massively overfilled stomach, you groan, unable to work up the strength to keep going.

	You fall to the ground, the beast's last attack bowling you over and knocking you on your back. You groan and lift your head to see that it is wasting no time; the $npc1.species has scooped your legs into its mouth with its tongue, and is quickly swallowing you into its throat. Pulling its head back with you in it, it lunges forward onto you, securing your body in its teeth as it forces you down its throat. After a few more of these, it marches forward slowly, its momentum causing you to slide into its maw and towards its stomach. When you are entirely in its mouth, it lifts its head upward, gravity and squeezing muscles sending you into its belly. You lose consciousness from your painful injuries and the beast's crushing stomach. 
<<else>>
	You push against it as your head goes into its maw, but are unable to deter it. It forces itself downward on you, its throat opening as it begins to swallow you head-first. You're in up to your chest, your arms pinned to your sides by its stretched mouth before it flips you upwards, its head and neck straightening to allow gravity to assist in pulling you straight for its belly. It swallows you again and again, pulling you towards its stomach several inches at a time. Your struggles prove fruitless as you simply can't get the leverage you need to escape, and as your hips enter its stretched throat, you begin to slide down its wet insides to its dark and cramped stomach. You can hear and feel the beast let out a satisfied rumble as its stomach begins to churn about you. The pressure and lack of air soon cause you to lose consciousness.

You're already feeling painfully full as its thick limbs slide down your throat and make a home in your belly, but you've gone too far to stop, and are helpless to do anything but swallow again and again, more and more of the manticore becoming a huge bulge in your midsection. You're lying on your back and rubbing at your groaning stomach even as you swallow down its shoulders, and when the rest of its body slides easily into your stuffed belly, you can't do anything but moan in pain, the immense pressure a sure sign that this meal was too much for you.

Slipping in close, you wait for $npc1.him to slap $npc1.his $npc1.hands together, before swiftly dodging the magic and getting your maw around $npc1.his $npc1.color $npc1.hands, holding $npc1.his wrists in your $p.teeth as you pull back, making $npc1.him lose $npc1.his footing, before you suck $npc1.him up to $npc1.his elbows. $npc1.He begins to roar and writhe, and you can feel $npc1.his magic seeping into you, eating away at your fatness, but imbuing you with a rush of strength, easily enough to keep pulling the $npc1.adjective in. $npc1.He starts to yell, "NO! I won't be just another meal! I refuse to be nothing but a layer of fat on a nobody like y-rfnrnf!" $npc1.His voice is cut off as your maw swallows past $npc1.his head, silencing $npc1.him as your maw gapes to its limits to get past the beast's shoulders.

Proud of yourself, you flop back onto your rump, ready for digestion, before your gut starts to grumble, there is a surge of power, before you feel your entire stomach give a lurch, and the form inside starts to reshape. You feel yourself filling up even more. Confused, you let forth a belch, and realize that the flavor you're tasting isn't $npc1.species at all! It tastes like two or three other anthros. The $npc1.species must have teleported out of your belly, only to replace $npc1.himself with some of what $npc1.he'd caught, and then some!

Your gut becomes so full and heavy that it pins you to the ground, to the point that you can't even see over it. The only thing keeping you going is all the struggling. You sigh with contentment as you reailze you can actually hold this meal. It's a long time before all that movement dies down, but it does. You give you swollen midsection a loving pat, before heaving yourself up. It finally dawns on you that both the $npc1.species and $npc1.his bag have long since disappeared, but at least you got quite the meal out of this!

	Unfortunately, by this point you're already as full as you can get, and there's no way you can polish off the second half of this meal. Sensing your pause, you can feel the magic surge again within you, only this time the $npc1.species seems to mean business. The world seems to shift, and before you even know what happened, you've traded places. You can feel the hot, powerful confines of the $npc1.species's gut around you, and your rump being hoisted high into the air, framed by the $npc1.species's $npc1.teeth. Unlike you, though, $npc1.he has no problem working your waistline down, and less than no trouble keeping your legs together as $npc1.he forces you completely into $npc1.him. $npc1.He gives your feet one final, taunting lick before gulping them down. You curl up into a ball, completely disoriented, before you can feel the $npc1.species giving $npc1.his gut a few powerful pats. $npc1.He makes a show of licking $npc1.his chops, growling assertively.

You decide that you don't want to fight any more and lower your defenses, hoping to get this over with quickly. The $npc1.species seizes the advantage and impales you on its stinger, the huge amount of poison overwhelming your body and leaving you unable to move. Though you are wracked with pain, you can still see the relatively small insects tending to the queen come over to you and crawl beneath you. As they congregate beneath you, you are dragged into the queen's chamber, at which point a flying insect picks you up. In a manner almost choreographed, you are buzzed over to the great, unmoving, somehow fat looking bloated insect's head. It opens its mandibles, and you are dropped into its mouth and swallowed easily. The buzzing of the hive becomes muted as you are engulfed by its innards, and the squeezing of its stomach on you causes you to finally lose consciousness.

		$npc1.He rushes and leaps at you, but you skillfully evade. $npc1.He hits the ground with an earth-shaking thud, but rolls up to face you again without hesitation. 

	<<elseif setup.weight() < 700>>
		Suddenly, $npc1.he rushes and leaps at you. The weight of $npc1.his body smashes into you and knocks you to the ground, and $npc1.his bulk crushes you painfully before you get out from under $npc1.him!

			Suddenly, $npc1.he rushes and leaps at you, smashing $npc1.his blubbery body into your own. The impact sends visible shockwaves through the thick fat enrobing both of you, but your massive bulk proves too much to topple. The $npc1.species growls in frustration as $npc1.he backs away, both $npc1.his belly and yours still wobbling as $npc1.he does so. 
		<<else>>
			Suddenly, $npc1.he rushes and leaps at you. You manage to brace yourself just in time as $npc1.he smashes $npc1.his blubbery body into your unyielding, muscular bulk. Calling upon your formidable reserves of strength, you stand firm and thrust the $npc1.species back, sending ripples through $npc1.his oversized belly as $npc1.he stumbles away.

You violently shove $npc1.his chest, sending $npc1.him sprawling backwards. $npc1.He lands on $npc1.his back with a tremendous thump, and as $npc1.he looks up, you are already pinning $npc1.his thick legs together and opening your mouth wide. With a wordless cry, $npc1.he rolls over and as you shove $npc1.his feet into your mouth and begin to swallow $npc1.him down, $npc1.he claws at the ground, desperately trying to slow your feast. 
<<consume $e.weight 0>>
<<if $alive>>
	$npc1.His broad hips slide into your mouth easily, your hungry swallowing bringing $npc1.his bulk ever closer to your belly. When you reach $npc1.his tremendous, flabby midsection, you snake your way forward, your jaw stretching wider and wider around the crest of $npc1.his jiggling belly. As you crest the mountain of flab, $npc1.he begins to slickly slide down your throat, the force of your gluttonous swallows easily outmatching $npc1.his desperate tugs at whatever handhold $npc1.he can get. $npc1.he lets out a frustrated growl as you suck down $npc1.his chest, your belly stretching with $npc1.his lower body. You respond with a growl of your own, but from your hungering stomach. $npc1.He pushes at your face in a bid to free $npc1.himself, but only manages to get $npc1.his arms stuck outside your mouth as you gulp $npc1.him down past the shoulders. $npc1.He lets out a defeated groan as $npc1.his blubbery neck starts to pass down yours, and $npc1.his arms slip down to follow $npc1.him into your $waist belly. You give your stomach a pat and a rub, feeling $hungry as you prepare to set off again.

	You slowly suck down $npc1.his broad hips, scarcely able to believe just how bulky this $npc1.species is. $npc1.His tremendously blubbery midsection hurts your stomach to even look at, but giving up never got anyone anywhere, so you make a valiant effort to get $npc1.him all down. $npc1.He sneers at you as you take your time, and taunts, "What's wrong? Does it hurt if I do THIS?" before beginning to move $npc1.his legs about inside you. It does indeed, but it also makes you swallow faster, and $npc1.he is in up to $npc1.his chest even before you're done wincing. "C'mon, $p.species!" $npc1.he continues mocking as you work your way around $npc1.his shoulders, grabbing your painfully stretched belly, "don't tell me little old me is gonna be too much for you!" You put your hands on $npc1.his head and violently shove $npc1.him down, $npc1.his taunts becoming muffled shouts. $npc1.His arms are the last thing down your throat, and as you swallow down the last of $npc1.him, you lean forward, your $waist stomach is the only thing holding you upright, splayed out and spread across the ground. You give it a slow rubbing, but can't even buy yourself much time before the immense fullness is too much for you and sends you drifting out of consciousness.

You hold up your hands in a sign of surrender, and the $npc1.species halts in $npc1.his tracks while you reach into your pack. 


<<if _surrenderFoodA == "">>
Unfortunately, you can't find anything, and can only offer an empty-handed shrug. $npc1.He obviously doesn't appreciate this, $npc1.his face becoming an angry scowl. "Then I guess I'm just gonna have to eat YOU!" $npc1.he bellows, tromping up to you and wrapping $npc1.his arms around you, pinning your arms to your sides in a firm grasp. You can't even struggle properly as $npc1.his mouth opens wide, the world becoming dark and wet as your head is forced into $npc1.his throat. $npc1.He eagerly forces you into $npc1.his elastic gullot, your bulk barely even slowing $npc1.him as $npc1.he greedily pulls you in. It is tight and slick before you are pulled into $npc1.his expansive stomach, which loosely and easily stretches to contain you. You curl up into a ball as the last of you is sucked down, and you hear a loud thumping as $npc1.he pats $npc1.his stomach. As the stomach walls clench down upon you, you are squeezed steadily tighter. The pressing and lack of air soon cause you to lose consciousness.

You pull out what food you have, and $npc1.he beckons impatiently. You try to find more, but simply don't have enough to appease $npc1.him. "Well then, I guess I'll just take that from you and rough you up a bit!" $npc1.he declares. You start to run, but $npc1.he has already slipped $npc1.his spear in front of your legs, and you trip, falling face down onto the ground. Before you can stand, there is a tremendous thud as $npc1.he jumps onto your back, knocking the wind out of you. "That oughta do it," $npc1.he says triumphantly, then gets up off you and slowly walks off, already eating your food. You stand up, brush yourself off, and go back to exploring.

You pull out a little food, to which $npc1.he responds by beckoning for more. When you present a second, $npc1.he does so a bit more impatiently. Upon presenting the third, $npc1.he nods acceptingly, taking them from you and starting to slowly devour them, heavy footsteps thumping down the road as $npc1.he walks steadily away. You decide to call this one a draw.
