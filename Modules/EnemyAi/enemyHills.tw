You see a look of what might be perplexity, or possibly happiness cross his face. It's pretty hard to tell though. In either case, he begins tearing off hunks of steak/sausage/ham/bacon from himself.

As you consume more and more of him, his body shifts and reconstructs into a smaller and smaller meat golem.
