As you hike along the side of a mountain, you come across a line of <<=setup.getSpeciesData("ant").plural>> marching in formation. This wouldn't be particularly noteworthy if they weren't the size of housecats and carrying away what looks to be an entire banquet. Several of them turn to you, mandibles flexing in a threatening manner.

<<case "thin">>
<<setEnemy $thinFur>>
As you explore the mountains, a thin shell of $npc1.article $npc1.species staggers across your path, holding $npc1.his stomach. Surprisingly, it is flat, though given that $npc1.he is currently taking the last few bites of what looks to have been an entire hock of ham, that seems very unusual. "Never lasts," $npc1.he grumbles quietly, "always need more. Never stay full." $npc1.He suddenly looks up and sees you, $npc1.his face turning into a twisted, angry grimace. "GIVE ME MORE FOOD!" $npc1.he suddenly bellows, dropping the meatless bone and suddenly pulling a nasty looking pair of daggers out! 


<<case "tough">>
<<setEnemy $toughFur>>
You are wandering through a particularly cold mountainside when your path is crossed by $npc1.article $npc1.species that is abnormally fat, even given the current state of things. $npc1.He appears to be completely unbothered by the inclimental weather, waddling up to you bare $npc1.furred. The sheer girth of $npc1.him becomes more apparent as $npc1.he gets closer--$npc1.his belly nearly hangs down to $npc1.his knees, and every inch of $npc1.his body bulges with thick fat. $npc1.He raises a wooden spear tipped with obsidian at you and demands, "Give me your food, or I'll squash you!" And with that, it's time to fight! 


<<case "magic">>
<<setEnemy $magicalFur>>
As you traverse the mountains, you come across $npc1.article $npc1.species in tattered robes holding $npc1.his head in both hands and walking in an almost drunken stagger. Given that $npc1.he is grunting and groaning with pain, you feel safe in assuming they aren't having that kind of fun at the moment. "Head hurts..." $npc1.he gasps out, "ALWAYS hurts..." As $npc1.he approaches, you can see that $npc1.his head does appear to be a bit swollen, but not nearly as much as $npc1.his gut. $npc1.He manages to lift $npc1.his head enough to see you, and hisses out, "...except when I get to EAT." With a staggered sweep, $npc1.he throws open one side of $npc1.his robe and pulls out an ugly, bent stick of a wand, pointing it at you menacingly! 


<<case "muscle">>
<<setEnemy $muscleFur>>
Your path is suddenly crossed by a lumbering hulk of $npc1.article $npc1.species. $npc1.He is exceptionally large, in height, musculature, and weight, $npc1.his massive belly easily being a third of $npc1.his mass, and is dragging something that could be called a club, but would be better described as a small tree. Upon spotting you, $npc1.he rumbles in a deep voice, "Eat more... Get bigger... Eat YOU... GET BIGGER!" $npc1.he rushes you, mouth open wide and club raised!

The dark snow-capped mountains loom around you in almost all directions, seemingly without end. Behind you an inviting path slopes downwards back into the rolling foothills of the mountains. Cold winds rip and howl through the rocky crags and tug sharply at you as if attempting to fling you off their mountain. The black cliffsides are pockmarked with small caves and outcroppings that could grant temporary sanctuary from the freezing cold, but who knows what else may be seeking shelter from the storm? On a distant peek you can make out the unusual yet unmistakable outline of a lonely white tower jutting vertically from a mountain side.

"THEN WE SHALL BEGIN!" the $npc2.species bellows overdramatically, raising $npc2.his staff. </p>

/*Experiment succesful*/

You can feel yourself getting heavier, warmer and softer as your fatty layer thickens. The $npc3.species is nearly fatless before the whispy tendril ceases to emanate from $npc3.him. You, on the other hand, are left $fatness with the addition of $npc3.his weight. </p>

<p>Above, the wizard throws $npc2.his hands over $npc2.his head and yells "Great success!" The $npc3.species, meanwhile, continues to chew on grains, a bored look on $npc3.his face. "My thanks for your participation, $p.sir!" the $npc2.species shouts down to you, "you may leave now." Before you can react, you find yourself back on the mountains, unable to spot the tower anymore. </p>

The $npc3.spcies raises $npc3.his foodless $npc3.hand and gives the most half-hearted thumbs-up you've ever seen. ''"THEN WE SHALL BEGIN!"'' the $npc2.species bellows, going quite a ways over the top as $npc2.he raises $npc2.his staff. </p>

<p>It splits into several smaller tendrils, and there's a momentary pinprick as they connect to your limbs, chest, neck and tail. As energy flows outward, the $npc3.species thins, and you can feel the magic steadily building in your muscles, which swell and harden nicely. The tendril stops flowing once the $npc3.species has thinned to a nearly fatless state, and you are left feeling significantly stronger. Unfortunately, you can also feel the magic slowly leaving you.

"Enjoy that while it lasts, $p.sir!" $npc2.he calls down, waving his staff. Before you can even react, the world blurs again, and you are back on the mountains, the tower nowhere in sight. </p>

<p>It splits into several smaller tendrils, and there's a momentary stabbing pain as they connect to your limbs, chest, neck and tail. Energy flows outward from the $npc3.species and into you, causing $npc3.him to thin, but you are definitely not feeling stronger. Your muscles are expanding, but feel heavy and cumbersome more than strong and flexible. The tendril stops flowing once the $npc3.species has thinned to a nearly fatless state, and you just look up to the wizard in confusion, your muscles significantly larger, but soft and not stronger at all. </p>

The $npc2.species wizard rubs $npc2.his chin and hums for a moment, then calmly begins, "Well, not quite as bad as the last few," then with exagerrated anger continues, "But I'll still call this a ''TOTAL FAILURE! CURSES!''" $npc2.He throws down $npc2.his staff in frustration, and it begins to glow brilliant white. "Oh dear, I did it again," $npc2.he mumbles, just before the world vanishes in a white glare.

''"THEN WE SHALL BEGIN!"'' the $npc2.species bellows, raising $npc2.his staff and failing to not look like a madman. 

<p>The staff glows a bright yellow, and a transparent red tendril flows outward from the $npc3.species's massive belly, snaking through the air towards you and splitting into several smaller tendrils when it approaches. </p>

Each weaves its way to one of your joints, the biggest tendril going around behind you, and with a

<<if random(1,3) == 1>>
slight pinprick, they poke into your major joints and spine. The $npc3.species steadily thins, and you can see the tendril send a stream of magical energy your way. When it reaches you, you get the unusual sensation of your joints becoming looser, and your muscles tightening. Somehow or another, this seems to be working, and your body feels lighter and faster. Your pulse quickens, and you feel more keen all around. 
<<buff "agi" 30 180>>


<p>Somehow or another, you do feel faster, though the feeling is slowly fading. Above, the wizard calls down, "Well?" To which the $npc3.species responds by throwing a few grains at you suddenly. You catch them reflexively, and the $npc2.species throws $npc2.his hands over $npc2.his head and yells, "Still not perfect, but still a great success! Thank you for your assistance, $p.sir!" With a wave of $npc2.his staff, the world blurs again, and you are somewhere on the mountains, but the tower is nowhere in sight. </p>

<p>By the time the flow stops, you are a jittery wreck, your $p.hands shaking like you've had enough caffeine to keep a $horse.species awake for a month. The only good thing about it is that it seems to be very slowly fading. From above, the wizard calls down, "Well?" The $npc3.species responds by tossing a few grains at you, which makes you flinch and cover your face as they harmlessly bounce off you. "Curses! Yet another failure!" $npc2.he bellows, then throws $npc2.his staff down in frustration. A brilliant white glow starts to build up, and you can hear $npc2.him mutter, "I've really got to stop doing that," just in time for a white flash to erupt all around. When your vision clears, you are somewhere on the mountains, but the tower is nowhere in sight. </p>

<p>"In this experiment, we shall try to make that skin of yours a little thicker with the addition of some flab!" $npc2.he calls down. "Are you ready, my flabby follower?" The $npc3.species raises $npc3.his free $npc3.hand, giving a nonchallant thumbs up without even ceasing $npc3.his snacking. ''"THEN WE SHALL BEGIN!"'' the $npc2.species bellows, raising $npc2.his staff and failing to strike an impressive pose. </p>

The staff glows green with magic, and a tendril of hazy red energy begins to flow out of the obese $npc3.species's midsection and toward yours. It pokes into the flesh of your belly with a 

/*Experiment succesful*/
<<if random(1,3) == 1>>
light pinprick, and as the energy flows outward, the $npc3.species begins to thin. Your body seems to thicken, and while it seems at first that you are simply getting fatter, as time passes, you can tell that your skin is getting tougher as well. You start to feel a bit warmer as your fatty layer seems to grow more dense. The tendril stops flowing when the $npc3.species has thinned to near-fatlessness, and when the last of the magical energy is absorbed, you are significantly more stout than you were before, but the feeling is slowly fading. 
<<set $fat += 20>>
<<buff "end" 30 180>>

<p>"Well?" the $npc2.species wizard yells down. The $npc3.species responds by giving you a bit of a slap in your $waist belly, which barely even moves and certainly doesn't hurt. The $npc3.species gives another nonchallant thumbs-up, never having stopped eating in this time, and the wizard bellows out, "Still don't have it down yet, but I shall call this a ''GREAT SUCCESS!''" while throwing $npc2.his hands over $npc2.his head. "Thank you for your assistance, $p.sir! Now allow me to show you out." The world blurs again, and you are back on the mountains, but the tower is nowhere in sight. </p>

brief stabbing pain, and as the energy flows outward, the $npc3.species begins to thin. You, on the other hand, seem to be bloating outward, your skin stretching as thick fat builds up under it. You find yourself getting quite hot, and a bit cramped by the additional weight. 
<<set $fat += 150>>
<<buff "agi" -30 180>>

<p>The tendril doesn't stop flowing into you until the $npc3.species is nearly fatless, and by that point, you've become $fatness in a most unbalanced way, your midsection disproportionate with your limbs. "Well?" the wizard calls down. The $npc3.species gives you a poke, and your $waist stomach jiggles softly, to which the $npc3.species gives a nonchallant half-shrug, still eating with $npc3.his other hand. "Then this is a ''TOTAL FAILURE!'' Blast it!" the $npc2.species yells, throwing down $npc2.his staff in frustration. A bright white glow starts to shine above you, and you can hear the wizard mumble, "I must remember not to do that."

''"THEN WE SHALL BEGIN!"'' the $npc2.species bellows, raising $npc2.his staff dramatically. </p>

The staff glows blue with magic, and a tendril of misty red energy begins to flow out of the fat $npc3.species's body and towards your head. It splits into two, which poke into the sides of your head with a

light pinprick. The $npc3.species thins as magical energy flows into you, and you can feel a bit of pressure inside your skull. Your thoughts begin to come faster, and you start to notice a bit more of the finer details of the spell, but the most obvious thing you can feel is your head getting very slightly larger. When the $npc3.species is nearly fatless, the tendril ceases to emanate from $npc3.him, and your head feels heavy, and slightly pained, with increased knowledge and mass.

While the first few pages are a sensible set of studious notes, the further it goes, the more jumbled and fragmented it gets. It may prove useful to someone, though.

<p>You lick your teeth as you knock away the wizard's staff, backing $npc2.him into a corner. "W-wait," $npc2.he stutters, "what are you doing? Y-y-you can't mean to--" $npc2.He cuts off as you grab $npc2.his arms, pinning them to $npc2.his sides. "No no!" $npc2.he cries. You open your mouth and lower it down upon $npc2.his head, $npc2.his protests becoming muffled yelps as you fit $npc2.him into your maw.

<p>You lift $npc2.him up, $npc2.his legs flailing under $npc2.his robes as you force $npc2.him into your throat. As $npc2.he descends to your stomach, $npc2.he struggles, but $npc2.his less-than-impressive physical strength makes it nothing but an interesting internal massage to you and your $waist belly. With a few more swallows, you gulp down $npc2.his chest, $npc2.his somewhat rounded midsection, then $npc2.his legs, and soon $npc2.he is nothing more than a crazed wizard bulge in your stomach. </p>

Your belly jiggles a bit as $npc2.he writhes inside you, and you give it a rubbing as it slowly calms and becomes still. That's the only thing that stays calm and still, as the staff's bright white glow catches your eye just in time for it to become an overwhelming flash of light. When it fades and your vision clears, you are somewhere in the mountains, and the tower is nowhere in sight. 

<<include "mountain randomization">>

You slowly lift $npc2.him upwards as you swallow $npc2.him down, $npc2.his legs flailing in the air as you push $npc2.him into your throat. Even as you pass $npc2.his shoulders, you feel this might have been a mistake, your stomach already protesting as $npc2.he slowly makes $npc2.his way down to it. $npc2.His pushing isn't enough to free $npc2.him, but is certainly enough to make you feel pain, and you have no choice but to gulp the rest of $npc2.him down into your overfilled, $waist stomach. You let out a groan as it shakes and shudders with the $npc2.species's struggles, and lower yourself to the ground, rubbing at it to try to ease the pressure. You're not able to do so just by will alone, unfortunately, and you soon drift off, your slow, deep breaths heralding an onset of unconsciousness.

<p>$npc2.His eyes widen and $npc2.he stammers, "Oh. I, er, I see you bested my, ah, my pet. The manticore." As you move, $npc2.he flinches, throwing his hands up submissively.

As you crest a particularly hard to reach mountaintop, you suddenly find yourself facing an odd, cylindrical tower that you didn't see on the way up. Given the way that it shimmers and sparkles, you can assume that it was either invisible, or simply not here, before you got this close. It is apparent that some sort of magic user lives here.

Picking up $npc2.his staff, $npc2.he makes a gesture at you and says "Just one moment while I take you to the proper facilities." The world blurs again, and you find yourself in a sterile, well-lit chamber. </p>

The only other thing in here is an extremely fat $npc3.species who is non-challantly chewing on grains, which $npc3.he keeps pulling from a large bag beside $npc3.him by the <<=$npc3.hand>>ful.

/*Make this text more dynamic based on state*/

<<if visited("Approach the cabal") == 1>>

<p>As you make your way inward, you are met by a pair of what are obviously guards flanking a very important looking, and very large, $npc1.species. The guards are easily <<sayDistance 84>> tall, and the $npc1.species is even taller than that. As they get closer, you can see that the $npc1.species's earth-brown robes only barely contain $npc1.his enormously muscular frame. 
</p>

$npc1.He approaches you and spreads $npc1.his arms welcomingly, though the serious look on $npc1.his face does not change. "Welcome, stranger," $npc1.he begins, $npc1.his voice a deep rumble, "You've come at an odd time. We are practicioners of the arts of body changing. We seek enlightenment through physical perfection, and utilize raw body mass as the means to alter our bodies. While excess material has been easy to come by in these curious days, our greatest asset has been lost to us." The $npc1.species shakes $npc1.his head, lowering $npc1.his arms. "If you wish to trade with us, we can change aspects of your body if you are willing to repay us with raw materials... That is to say, body fat. We are also willing to trade it for coin, should you so desire." 

<<else>>

<p>The huge and muscular $npc1.adjective guard with the earth-brown robes stands stands at attention as always.

<p>One of the guards seems to pause for a moment, then makes a furtive gesture to the $npc1.species. $npc1.He gives a nod, and says, "My associate believes you have a wyvern's egg. Perhaps we could make you an offer, if you would be interested in trading it." </p>

The $npc2.species gives you a looking over, walking over to poke your $waist belly with $npc2.his staff. $npc2.He shakes $npc2.his head, and says, "I'm afraid you just don't have the mass to make you larger to a significant degree. You'll just have to come back when you have about <<sayWeight _cost>> of fat you need to get rid of. Perhaps there's something else I can do for you instead."

<p>"Alright then, hold still." At that, the $npc2.species begins to slowly wave $npc2.his staff in odd patterns, chanting out arcane syllables carefully. The magic circle you are standing in glows, and a hazy red tendril of energy begins to emanate from your $fatness midsection. It splits into multiple smaller tendrils and flows back into your limbs, chest, neck, and spine, though one leads back to the $npc2.species and into $npc2.his belly. Your body slims steadily, and your feet begin to sink away from you.

A quick examination of yourself shows you that your body is, surely enough, enlarging. As you grow, $npc2.his belly swells larger and larger. Eventually, the tendril ceases to flow out of you, leaving you standing <<sayDistance $p.height>> tall, and the $npc2.species letting out a hum and patting at $npc2.his bloated stomach.

$npc2.He gives you a thorough looking over and shakes $npc2.his head. "It'd be dangerous to make you smaller without extra material to reshape what's left," $npc2.he explains. "Please, come back when you've got at least <<sayWeight _cost>> to throw around, so to speak."

The magic circle you are standing in responds, beginning to glow, and a hazy red tendril of magical energy begins to flow out of your $fatness midsection. Several smaller tendrils snake off of it and flow back into your arms, legs, chest, spine, and neck, but one lazily floats toward the $npc2.species's belly.

The world seems to get bigger around you, but as you give yourself a closer look, you confirm that you are, indeed, getting smaller. As you get smaller, $npc2.his belly bulges bigger and bigger. After a few more moments, the tendril ceases to flow out from you, leaving you <<sayDistance $p.height>> tall, and the $npc2.species gives a hum as $npc2.he rubs at $npc2.his swollen belly.

"One of our number has gone rogue, and taken our most valuable artifact with $npc2.him: An enchanted cauldron that once stored all of the magical energies that we utilize to alter a body. The kind of power $npc2.he has available to $npc2.him..." The $npc1.species shakes $npc1.his head, $npc1.his brow furrowed, then continues.

<<else>>
"Glad to hear that," $npc1.Name nods, then launches into an explanation. 

<</if>></p>

<p>"There's a wizard out there who's having folks delivered to $npc3.him and experimenting on them. Unfortunately, $npc3.he's not very good at it, and all the people you see here and out wandering the mountains are the result. Through a bit of a fluke, what $npc3.he did actually worked without leaving me crippled with pain, so I've been working on how to fix things up. I've gotten this far on my own, and those of us here at least have a way to channel our aggression safely and productively, but if I want to have a chance to reverse things, I'm going to need $npc3.his notes." </p>

<p>$npc1.He stands up and leads you outside. $npc2.Name is leaning against a wall closeby. "$npc2.Name, be a love and help our guest find whatever $p.he needs. $p.He's going to help us now," $npc1.he says to $npc2.him. $npc2.He lets out a happy rumble and marches up to you. "$npc2.Name can show you to the farm, the smith, and back to me. I've got a few spells I've scrounged up if you can use them, and the smith still has $npc4.his wits and $npc4.his skill, thank heavens. Take a look around and get what you need; that $npc3.species has a nasty pet waiting for you, so you'll want to be prepared." </p>

<p>At that, $npc1.he heads back inside, pouring over $npc1.his books again. $npc2.Name looks at you and rumbles, "$npc1.Name's your friend now. You hurt $npc1.Name, you get crushed." Despite the words, $npc2.he doesn't look quite as angry as before. </p>

You accept the insect queen's offer, and follow the small worker as it leads you back out of the cave. When you are out, it drops the lump of wax it was holding. On closer inspection, you can see that it is a thinly-coated lump of royal jelly, ready to eat whenever you want it. Given the immense magic coming off it, it doesn't seem like a bad prize at all.

There appears to be two primary directions you can get to, lacking the ability to fly as you do: The left path leads to a chamber that <<=setup.getSpeciesData("ant").plural>> with swollen abdomens enter and march out of again less engorged.

One of the giant <<=setup.getSpeciesData("ant").species>>-like creatures with engorged thoraxes crawls into the middle of a group of larva, turning its thorax to each in turn and exuding what appears to be extremely thick, dense honey into their mouths. Surprisingly, the larva grow in size as they eat, rapidly redoubling in bulk before pulling away from the feeding insect.

It hovers in the air and points its stinger at you threateningly. It does not attack immediately, and you get a fairly clear view of a grossly oversized insectoid, unable to move under its own girth. It is tended to by smaller insects, shoving honey into its mouth and collecting eggs from behind its thorax. If you want to approach it, you're going to have to go through its guard...

As the massive insect slumps over and goes still, you spot something glinting at the end of its thorax. Going down to take a look, you see the <<=setup.getSpeciesData("wasp").species>>-like aspect of it has left this deceased creature with a very long stinger. On top of that, it looks loose. You give it a few good yanks, and the stinger dislodges. It is long enough, hard enough, and pointy enough to use as a long thrusting weapon, and it even has a bit that was inside the queen that is thin enough to use as a hand hold... after you wash it off. You take your new weapon and head back out to continue exploring.

You lick your lips, your face a dripping mess of sticky sweetness, before coming to realize that all the insects have stopped entirely. It seems that they didn't expect this to happen and have completely locked up.

When you're inside it, however, it becomes apparent that you have been shoved into a hollowed out comb, as you feel the waxy walls all around you. </p>

<p>As the insects finish jamming you into the chamber, a few of the <<=setup.getSpeciesData("wasp").plural>> begin to disgorge wax on you.

<<setPassageTitle "Attack the mountainous $npc1.species">>

<p>You let forth a shout and charge forward. The $npc1.species tying $npc1.his bag shut before turning to you, looking a bit surprised. As you draw close you can see just how built $npc1.he is. Clad in only a dark loincloth, $npc1.he is all but drowning in $npc1.his own muscle. $npc1.His head is all but buried between $npc1.his chest and $npc1.his back, and $npc1.his biceps are easily larger than you were before the start of your journey.<<if $npc1.nspecies == "tiger">> $npc1.His $npc1.stripes cling to $npc1.his bulges for dear life.<</if>></p>

$npc1.He leers at you as you approach, before turning around and giving $npc1.his overmuscled bubble-butt a taunting slap. "You wanna play? Let's play!"

<p>There are hazy memories of roaming the mountain and eating, being fed sweet honey by massive insects, and devouring unwary travellers and all their food whole. You lose track of time, and the world is only clear again when you stand before your captor once more, massively overfed and awaiting $npc1.his command. $npc1.He beckons, and you slowly haul yourself to $npc1.his $npc1.feet before embracing $npc1.his huge belly. The $npc1.species lets out a deep growl, and you feel yourself slowly sink in to $npc1.his huge, soft stomach. It engulfs you, a soft, gelatinous grey pillow that sucks you into its squishy warmth, wrapping around you gently but firmly, pulling you in. </p>


<p>$npc1.He wraps $npc1.his arms around you, pulling you into $npc1.him as the majority of your body below your neck is engulfed by $npc1.his now-ooze-like belly. You are over-joyed to finally be being consumed... And at that moment, $npc1.he touches your head, releasing $npc1.his control of your thoughts. You have just enough time for the realization of what's happened to sink in before $npc1.he shoves your head inside of $npc1.him, and you are soon turned into more of $npc1.his massive stomach. </p>

<<createFixedNPC "cabalRogue">>

You follow the map to a cliff face and find an unlit cave. Stepping inside reveals the darkness to be an illusion; once you set foot within, you are greeted by a large, lit passageway. Following it deeper inside, you come to a huge, dome-shaped chamber. A magical force triggers behind you, barring the way you came. A deep, rumbling voice booms out, "So, the cabal has sent another meal to me? How kind of them!" The entire floor lights up in a gigantic magical circle, and a gigantic anthropomorphic $npc1.color $npc1.species is revealed to be before you, light glinting off $npc1.his eyes and sharp teeth. With no way out, you steel yourself for battle!

You realize that if such a massive $npc1.adjective had no trouble catching that many people, $npc1.he probably wouldn't have a problem forcing you to join them. Turning tail, you scurry back down the hill you came up, hoping $npc1.he didn't see you.

<<setPassageTitle "A mountainous $npc1.species">>

As you crest a hill, you find yourself looking down at a scene in progress a good hundred yards away. $npc1.Article $npc1.species of improbable musculature seems rather occupied with tying up a particularly fat $npc2.species. From this distance, you gauge $npc1.him to be about a good fifteen feet in height, but larger than $npc1.him is what appears to be a sack, the size of a building, in black cloth and gold-thread embroidery. The $npc1.species hefts up the helpless $npc2.species, pulling open the mouth of the bag and stuffing $npc2.him right in. You suddenly realize that the entire bulging payload is filled to the brim with all manner of fattened captives.
