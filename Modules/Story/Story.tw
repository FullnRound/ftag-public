:: Info {"position":"3075,450","size":"100,100"}
''This twine version''
<hr>
I hope this all works? Editing is a work in progress though

''Buttons''
<hr>
Stats describes your appearance, equipment, quests, and any important status effects. 
Surroundings gives you a description of your surroundings. 
Inventory brings up your inventory. 
Rest lets you rest for an hour. Regaining health and stamina and giving you a chance to digest. 
Spells brings up a list of your spells. 

The 12 buttons to the right are the choices your character can make. Usually referring to which direction you want to go. 

Near the center of the screen there's a few more buttons. 
Info brings up this dialogue. 
Options beings up the options menu. 
Load allows you to load a previous save. 

''Stats''
<hr>
Strength affects how much time/stamina it costs to travel somewhere. 
Agility affects who goes first in combat as well as increasing your odds to dodge/escape during combat. It also reduces the time it takes to travel somewhere. 
Endurance affects how quickly you lose stamina, as well as how quickly you regain health from resting. It also affects how much your maximum HP increases when you level up. 
Intelligence affects your chance to dodge/escape from your opponent as well as allowing you to go first in combat. It also affects your maximum mana and which spells you can learn. 
Intelligence/Strength/Agility each affect the damage scaling on different weapons based on the type of weapon. Each stat also has an affect on special events where it's applicable. 
Your secondary stats are: 
Health, which you need to keep above 0 to stay alive. 
Stamina, which you need to keep above 0 to be able to travel. 
Mana, which you spend to cast spells you've learned. 
Fullness, which represents how much you can safely consume. 

''Food''
<hr>
Eating stuff obviously fills your stomach, and it usually gives you calories which turn into fat over time. 
If you eat over 100% of your stomach's regular capacity, your maximum health will be temporarily reduced based on how overstuffed you are. However being over 100% full will also stretch your stomach out over time, increasing your stomach capacity. 
If you get to 130% of your stomach's capacity then your maximum health is reduced to 0, ostensibly causing you to "explode" or at least pass out, based on your interpretation. So try to not to stuff yourself into unconsiousness, unless you feel like it of course. 

''Exploration''
<hr>
Outside of the safety of the city there are three wilderness areas; the forest, the hills, and the plains. In these areas you can randomly encounter various random enemies as well as finding special events and items. Ostensibly, the forest has the easiest enemies, followed by the plains, which is followed by the hills which has the hardest enemies of those 3 areas. There is also a small town to the west that leads to a beach area where you can also find random enemies/items/events as well as being home to the mage's guild. 

''Specific locations''
<hr>
Your house: You can save and load games from your bedroom inside your house. You can also sleep there, which just lets you rest for 8 hours. There is also your storage chest where you can store and receive items as well as gold. 
Restaurants: Eating at a restaurant confers a small temporary bonus to your stats. 
Training grounds: Training grounds allow you to burn fat and convert it into Strength/Agility as well as endurance. 
Stores: Any location with a store icon has some amount/type of items to sell. You can also sell things to most vendors. 
Hospital/Church: This is where you end up after being defeated. 
Mage's guild: In the town on the west side of the world there is a mage's guild where you can learn spells as well as train up your intelligence at the cost of fat. 

''Combat''
<hr>
Defeating enemies gains you xp which allow you to level up. When you level up, you can increase one of your stats as well as automatically healing you and increasing your max health. You can also often find gold and sometimes find items dropped by defeated enemies. 
During combat you have several actions you can take: 
Attack causes you to attack your enemy with your equipped weapon. 
Item let's you use an item from your inventory. 
Run allows you to attempt to run away from combat. 
Spells allows you to cast known spells at the cost of mana. 
Wait allows your enemy to get a free attack in on you, but regains some of your stamina. 
Submit allows you to surrender to your enemy and suffer whatever consequences that entails. 
Devour allows you to attempt to devour your enemy if your stomach capacity is high enough and you can overpower/outwit/outmaneuver your opponent. Be wary though, it only means you could successfully eat the foe on an empty stomach. Depending on how full you already are, eating an enemy may push you over your limit and actually cause you to lose the fight. It is also worth noting that devouring an enemy prevents you from picking up any items they may have otherwise dropped. 
Struggle causes you to fight against your opponent once they have grappled you. Whichever stat is highest between Strength/Agility/Intelligence is used against your opponents grapple until you finally break free. 

''Status effects''
<hr>
There are various status effects that you and your enemy can be subjected to. Namely: 
Stunned characters have a 1/3 chance of their action in combat not happening. 
Burned characters take a certain amount of damage at the start of each of their actions. 
Poisoned characters take a certain amount of damage at the start of each of their actions and you also take damage over time outside of combat. 
Slowed characters act last in combat for a certain number of turns. 
Regeneration characters regenerate a certain amount of health every turn, or every 10 minutes out of combat. The regeneration effect only lasts for a limited duration. 
Stat changes (strength, agility, etc.) can be increased or decreased as a result of certain actions. 
Most of these status effects are only temporary and go away after combat unless noted otherwise. 

''Spells''
<hr>
In the western town there's a mage's guild where you can learn spells. You can only learn a spell if your base intelligence is high enough and if you have enough money to pay for them to teach you. Certain spells can only be cast in combat, other spells can only be cast out of combat, and some spells can be cast either in or out of combat. All spells require you to spend a certain amount of mana to cast them. Mana is regained automatically over time or you can restore mana more directly by drinking mana potions. 

''Defeat''
<hr>
If your health drops to 0, either from damage or from overeating or any other reason, then you are defeated. If any of your stats ever fall to 0 (usually from stat altering attacks) then you are also defeated. You're character never actually permanently "dies" though, so depending on the situation you either end up at the hospital or church. The penalties for this is the loss of some gold, plus the loss of everything you've eaten and whatever calories you had stored up before being defeated. Also most temporary status effects end when you are defeated. So try not to be too reckless.

<p>Hospital/Church: This is where you end up after being defeated. 
Mage's guild: In the town on the west side of the world there is a mage's guild where you can learn spells as well as train up your intelligence at the cost of fat. </p>

<hr>
''Combat''
<p>Defeating enemies gains you xp which allow you to level up. When you level up, you can increase one of your stats as well as automatically healing you and increasing your max health. You can also often find gold and sometimes find items dropped by defeated enemies. </p>

During combat you have several actions you can take: 
<li>Attack causes you to attack your enemy with your equipped weapon. </li>

<li>Item let's you use an item from your inventory. </li>

<li>Run allows you to attempt to run away from combat. </li>

<li>Spells allows you to cast known spells at the cost of mana. </li>

<li>Wait allows your enemy to get a free attack in on you, but regains some of your stamina. </li>

<li>Submit allows you to surrender to your enemy and suffer whatever consequences that entails. </li>
/* FIXES AND EDITS - Alter Devour option availability */
<li>Devour allows you to attempt to devour your enemy if your stomach capacity is high enough and you can overpower/outwit/outmaneuver your opponent. Be wary though, as the action may be available even if you couldn't successfully eat the foe in your current state (options depending). Depending on how full you already are, eating an enemy may push you over your limit and actually cause you to lose the fight. It is also worth noting that devouring an enemy prevents you from picking up any items they may have otherwise dropped. </li>

<li>Struggle causes you to fight against your opponent once they have grappled you. Whichever stat is highest between Strength/Agility/Intelligence is used against your opponents grapple until you finally break free. </li>

<hr>
''Status effects''
There are various status effects that you and your enemy can be subjected to. 

<li>Stunned characters skip their next action. </li>

<li>Burned characters take a certain amount of damage at the end of each round. </li>

<li>Poisoned characters take a certain amount of damage at the end of each round and you also take damage over time outside of combat. </li>

<li>Slowed characters act last in combat for a certain number of turns. </li>

<li>Regeneration characters regenerate a certain amount of health every turn, or every 10 minutes out of combat. The regeneration effect only lasts for a limited duration. </li>

<li>Stat changes (strength, agility, etc.) can be increased or decreased as a result of certain actions.</li> 

<p>Most of these status effects are only temporary and go away after combat unless noted otherwise. </p>

<hr>
''Defeat''
<p>If your health drops to 0, either from damage or from overeating or any other reason, then you are defeated. </p>

<p>If any of your stats ever fall to 0 (usually from stat altering attacks) then you are also defeated. </p>

<p>You're character never actually permanently "dies" though, so depending on the situation you either end up at the hospital or church. The penalties for this is the loss of some gold, plus the loss of everything you've eaten and whatever calories you had stored up before being defeated. Also most temporary status effects end when you are defeated. So try not to be too reckless. </p>


:: Introduction [intro city] {"position":"2325,850","size":"100,100"}
<p>You are a member of society living on a small but peaceful and fertile patch of land. In their recorded history no one has known of strife or want in this land of seemingly endless abundance. Lately though the land has become peculiarly more fertile. Crops grow faster and larger than ever before. The wilderness has started regrowing and encroaching back on civilization at an alarming rate. The animals have responded by ravenously devouring everything in sight. This includes the wild carnivores who have been glutting themselves on the hopelessley fattened animals. Lately they have even been attacking and devouring the townsfolk who venture too far into the wilderness. </p>

<p>In addition to the animals, even the more civilized denizens of the land have slowly begun to lose themselves to gluttony and hedonism, more so than usual anyway. Nobody seems to know why the sudden change has come across everyone. In fact, nobody seems to even particularly notice or care. </p>

<p>Today though, you awake from another night of restless dreams and finally decide that there must be something more out there, and thus begins your journey towards adventure! </p>

<br>-Fixed running from unrunnable enemies being weird. 
<br>-Fixed some typos. 
<br>-Changed tough fur's attacks slightly thanks to Someoneoutthere!

<li>Version 0.63</li>
-Slightly reduced enemy stats. You'll need to click "Fix enemy stats" under <<popup "Game fixes" "hot fixes">>.
<br>-Reduced enemy damage rolls. 
<br>-Slightly increased armor values of armor. Will have to use the "Update items" link in <<popup "Game fixes" "hot fixes">>, which will only update new copies of the armor you get.

<br>-Added sleep button to places where you can sleep so you can sleep while you sleep. 
<br>-Chenged how studying at the mage guild works to be more consistent with other areas.

<li>Version 0.62d</li>
-I think I have added a dark mode to the options menu? I have no idea how well this will work, and I'm really hoping it doesn't do any sort of weird flickering. Please let me know if it works!

<li>Version 0.62c</li>
-And now I've changed the ui again to be much more like the original! I kind of liked the dark version, but this is more visually interesting. Also I'm starting to think I should get rid of that bottom bar because it's been giving me a lot of problems. Or maybe I should learn html better. But either way, let me know what you think! 
<br>-Fixed levelling up not working. 

<li>Version 0.62b</li>
-Changed the ui again to be more mobile friendly maybe? It introduces some new, but hopefully lesser problems.

<br>-The tailor now actually properly reimburses you when you hand of the wizard's robes for Sampson's quest. 

<li>Version 0.62</li>
-The UI update! Exciting I know. But I changed how the entire user interface works, and if the UI breaks then the game becomes legit unplayable. So I'm going to try to focus on the UI for this update, and if things go terribly wrong then I'll just revert to a previous version. But things //should// be working properly and it //should// be slightly better on mobile. But you'll have to let me know if it works or not.

<br>-Fixed logical error in jungle shaman quest.

<br>-The bottom bar should be more mobile friendly?
<br>-The movement grid changes based on screen size in a hopefully good way? 
<br>-Font size reduced on smaller screens.

<br>-You should no longer be defeated at the restaurant if you end up under 130% full after eating. 

<li>Version 0.61l</li>
-Hydra's item drop chance increased from 1% to 100%. Click on the "Fix enemy stats" in <<popup "Game fixes" "hot fixes">> to apply this change.

<br>-Fixed some more typos.

<br>-It should be no longer possible to get extra slime items while on Bronk's quests. 
<br>-Added link to <<popup "Game fixes" "hot fixes">> that'll remove all slimes from your inventory, in case you have too many. 
<br>-Added link to <<popup "Game fixes" "hot fixes">> that fixes description of stretchyseaweed. You'll have to get rid of all your old copies of it before this button'll do anything.

<br>-Changed how resting works in a way that's hopefully better.

<br>-Gender settings should work in more situations. Hopefully this doesn't have unforseen consequences, but I think it should work fine? 

-<li>Version 0.61g</li>
-Fixed not being able to leave when talking to Sampson during Strength quest. 
<br>-Fixed mana potions being named "health" potions. Will probably have to get rid of old potions and use <<popup "Game fixes" "hot fixes">> link to fix names.

					<<case "regular">>
						You have a nearly weightless body with neither health not vigour to boast. Your airy build is highly polarizing to people you encounter, who either consider you a paragon of feminine beauty or an unfortunate victim of a particularly vicious diet. 

					<<case "athletic">>
						You have a lean, toned and flexible body of an outgoing $p.boy. It's difficult for others to fault your vitality but your lack of volume in traditionally feminine areas makes it easy to discount your gender altogether. 

					<<case "muscular">>
						You have a decidedly athletic constitution lacking any superfluous weight. It's not unheard of to encounter a $p.man so strong and resilient, although such an appearance of physical accomplishment in someone so unlikely makes people - especially the males - wary and intimidated. 

					<<case "bodybuilder">>
						You have an immaculatly sculpted body of a warrior princess, superbly muscled and devoid of fat. The reaction that your appearance tends elicit from those who surround you is either cautious fear or cheers of adoration. 

				<</switch>>
			<<case "healthy">>
				<<switch $strengthTier>>
					<<case "regular">>
						You have an ordinary body with somewhat pleasant features, but your lack of exercise or fresh air is evident as well. Folks around your tend to regard you as being on the cute side of homely, and don't mind your presence. 

					<<case "athletic">>
						You have an fit and flexible body of an outgoing $p.boy who isn't afraid to act on her ambitions - especially if it involves exciting activities or travel. Most young men and a number of <<print $p.boy>>s as well find both your swift, measured motions intensely entrancing, and even the rest are comfortable to have someone light-footed still waltzing through the ranks of the increasingly portly populace of this land. 

					<<case "muscular">>
						You have a decidedly athletic constitution that glow with lush vigour and stamina despite lacking any external pudge. It would have been intimidating for some to come across a $p.gentleman of such powerful stature if your feminine features weren't so well-pronounced and attention-gripping. 

					<<case "bodybuilder">>
						You have a gloriously built, burly body that is the picture of paramount athletic success and proportionately distributed brawn. It is a veritable one-person martial parade when you plod down the streets of any town, and many people automatically assume you to be a military leader or someone of equal authority and capability. 

				<</switch>>
			<<case "robust">>
				<<switch $strengthTier>>
					<<case "regular">>
						You have a somewhat curvaceous figure, but it would be a far cry to call you fat - rather, every surface of your body is delicately and finely enhanced with results of hearty meals past. Your peers don't hesitate to include you in their enterprises, although being mindful of your self-evident distaste for physical activity. 

					<<case "athletic">>
						You have a capable and resourceful body, with a fashionable little of extra weight evenly distributed among its features. You find a degree of admiration wherever you turn, either for your adventerous spirit and energy, or for your pleasant proportions. 

					<<case "muscular">>
						You have a powerful and nimble frame that is subtly softened in some places and given additional volume in others. Folk around you are often prone to oogling your strong, statueque, yet inescapably feminine constitution. 

					<<case "bodybuilder">>
						You have an excellently trained and developed physique that is given a bit of tenderness by the softer contours that people who reach such breathtaking athletic heights can seldom afford to keep. Some of the more conservative-minded of the friendly folks you can encounter in the unforgiving wilderness have a hard time aligning in their minds your excellent survival skills with your somewhat plush bodily texture, but the rest express humbled and honoured attitude to your presence. 

				<</switch>>
			<<case "overweight">>
				<<switch $strengthTier>>
					<<case "regular">>
						You have a flossy plump figure, untouched by hard work or deprivations of long journey, making the challenges of dabbling in those matters uncomfortably arduous. People around you are often friendly and accepting of your presence, especially if you agree to share a dining table with them. 

					<<case "athletic">>
						You have a reasonably full figure, but the rounder curves don't do much to impede your vigorous lifestyle even if the tone of your muscles remains concealed. Strangers and acquaintances alike consider themselves fortunate to share your company, eager to enjoy your vim and your healthy looks. 

					<<case "muscular">>
						You have a decently filled-out body that has been rendered firm and maneuverable by an arduous and adventerous lifestyle. People in your vicinity are often surprised by the displays of power and grace that your ostensibly plush frame is capable of, and there are few situations where you cannot either make your strengths profitably useful or garner popularity by conversing over a full plate and foaming tankard. 

					<<case "bodybuilder">>
						You have a thickset constitution owing most of its girth to the great metallic might that evidences itself unmistakably despite the noticeable padding of your frame. Those who find themselves in your festively conspicuous presence are eager to accept your protection and authority should you choose to take charge, and your curvaceousness is seldom left uncomplimented by the more audacious folks. 

				<</switch>>
			<<case "chubby">>
				<<switch $strengthTier>>
					<<case "regular">>
						You have a generously replete body that lends profoundly to the naturally prominent areas of $p.male physique, but lacks the vigour to support that slpendor properly. In a social setting, you are welcome, admired and appreciated, but the life of physical exertion would seem to be an uncooth absurdity for someone like you. 

					<<case "athletic">>
						You have a plushly pudgy body that is, oddly enough, more fit and flexible than those of less encumbered <<print $p.boy>>s. Those leading a more indolent lifestyle are often taken aback by your bouts of energetic activity, and people of action don't think less of your abilities for the bouncy quality of your movements. 

					<<case "muscular">>
						You have a seasoned, strong body that is also richly enough padded to exaggerate every forceful movement with a bit of delayed fleshy feedback. Though you tend to mingle around leaner, more athletic types, both the squishy townspeople and the hardened wilderness explorers recognize your ability and strive to be the ones sitting beside you around the fire. 

					<<case "bodybuilder">>
						You have a thick, powerful physique of an accomplished athlete that still remains downy to the touch, and your unstoppable charges and dashing evasive rolls appear even more impressive for the volume-enchancing keepsakes of old ample meals dancing in time with the action. Unless you're too far removed from civilization or being discreet, there is always an audience gathering to see your fights and your feasts, and you tend to finish both with more friends and admirers than you started with. 

				<</switch>>
			<<case "corpulent">>
				<<switch $strengthTier>>
					<<case "regular">>
						You have a profoundly plump, heavyset body that, despite proudly displaying outstanding curves, is visibly burdensome for you to move around. Most often you are perceived as matronly and good-tempered, and on occassions receive caring advices to avoid unnecessary exertion. 

					<<case "athletic">>
						You have a body as well-fed and filled out as decency allows while still remaining energetic and flexible, although the limits of your mobility are significantly diminished. Ladies of your constitution often cannot keep up with you, and your willinglness to take up physical challenges makes fitter people disregard your chubby looks as a source of prohibitive encumberance; however, your pleasantly portly looks are always a welcome decoration of a merry evening feast. 

					<<case "muscular">>
						You have a fairly fat body with more than enough power under all the supple layers to compensate for the supefluous weight, even if it trades litheness for greater force. More often than not your generous proportions leave your unfortunate foes and travel companions aghast at how little they drag you down in quickly unravelling situations, but you would never refuse an hour of resting and feasting by the fire after an arduous and fighting-intensive venture. 

					<<case "bodybuilder">>
						You have a phenomenally burly frame with an abundance of flab softening and firming parts of you, but it's a well-balanced arrangement that prevents you from being viewed as overtly angular or flabby. Folks from all walks of life are thrilled to be bask in the confidence and stalwart power you weave with your posture alone; after all, a dame that has evidentally been able to acquire such might without the effort stripping her of lush gravitas is a natural object of admiration. 

				<</switch>>
			<<case "obese">>
				<<switch $strengthTier>>
					<<case "regular">>
						You have a thoroughly well-fed, lush constitution with ample curves making up the most of you, and the lack of appropriately intensive exercise needed to account for that luxuriant build is made evident whenever you face physical challenges. Those you meet and interact with seldom fail to adopt an ingratiating tone, suspecting that a person of your weight and bearing absolutely must be someone to be reckoned with, although many shift into a more familiar attitude soon after. 

					<<case "athletic">>
						You have a thoroughly well-fed, lush constitution with ample curves making up the most of you, and while the lack of appropriately intensive exercise need to account for that luxuriant build is made evident whenever you face physical challenges, you do have some untapped resources for mobility. Those you meet and interact with seldom fail to adopt an ingratiating tone, suspecting that a person of your weight and bearing absolutely must be someone to be reckoned with, although many shift into a more familiar attitude soon after. 

					<<case "muscular">>
						You have a more than generously filled-out body, but it's quite obvious that not all of your thickness had come from good eating, if only by the firmness and confidence of your movements. Wherever you go, the sheer size of you and your adroitness in handling it makes the local populace see an authority that naturally puts you in charge of handling any crises if such should arise, no matter the severity thereof. 

					<<case "bodybuilder">>
						You have a body remarkably rich in both muscle and fat, and although the latter tends to hide the former most of the time, it's your unwavering fortitude of stance and the force of moves that introduce you as a $p.gentleman of action first, and a voluptuous gourmand dame second. The attitude towards you tends to be that of admiration and deference with a hint of judicious wariness, since your formidable athleticism insinuates its way through the tender layers of your dignified looks a little too strongly.

					<<case "regular">>
						You have a profoundly portly body swimming with expansive convexities and sloshing bulges, and all that flesh starts to quake and shiver at the slightest turn or jolt, requiring a constant vigil over your posture to avoid a noisy collapse. People in your vicinity often lend you their respect as well as curiosity, aware of how much it must have cost to attain and maintain such a grand physique, although your laborious motions and shortness of breath attracts some sympathetic glances as well. 

					<<case "athletic">>
						You have a profoundly portly body swimming with expansive curves and thick folds, and all that flesh starts to quake and shiver at a slightest turn or jolt, requiring a constant vigil over your posture to avoid a noisy collapse, and you never fail to keep it. People in your vicinity often lend you their respect as well as curiosity, aware of how much it must have cost to attain and maintain such grand physique, although your laborious motions lead them to conjecture that you don't belong with the adventuring lot. 

					<<case "muscular">>
						You have an inordinately corpulent body with sloping protrusions given to wobbling and undulating at the changes of their momentum, but you are in definite control over setting your path. Friends and miscellaneous townfolk find your heavy frame to be both a sign of prosperity and social class, and you are never refused a hearty smile and a reverential bow, and even beyond the city gates your massive stature is a beacon of security for those seeking shelter. 

					<<case "bodybuilder">>
						You have a stout body with a clear feel of might and potency to your stance and martial prowess, made all the more impressive for the billowing rotund bulk of excess weight that you manage to keep in check, with the exception of harmless rippling and quivering after each dash or swing. In the social scene of any town you visit, your hardy confidence and determination in conjunction with your mass are quick to earn you a reputation of a mother figure to the entire community, making people flock to you for advice, protection and recipe consultations.

						You have the body of a lifelong glutton that is given most of its voluminous definition by firm and bountiful layers of fat rather then bones or muscle, and it takes all of your strength and focus to combat the wild swings of the more bulging parts of you that any drastic movement entails. Seeing as the most prominently well-fed folks around tend to be either successful gastronoms and combatants or savoury morsels for the countryside's numerous predators, your difficulties in managing the weighty baggage of your loose flesh engender sympathy and protective attitude in those around you, although in safer settings behind the city walls you are often treated as a goddess of plenty and a paragon of epicurean living.

					<<case "muscular">>
						You have an immensely fat constitution with abounding, lush curves dancing with delicate ripples and forceful quivering on the rare occasions you are forced to move quickly, but the very fact of you being capable of such bouts despite the obvious hindrance speaks volumes about the strength your round supple surfaces hide. Those you have dealings with are usually inclined to give any request or inquiry of yours top priority, recognizing how your corporeal weight reflects that of your experience in life, your confident bearing and expansive presence further cementing your authority and securing further admiration. 

					<<case "bodybuilder">>
						You have an outstandingly corpulent frame, its vast rounded surfaces firmed with grandiose fat deposits and plenty of harder flesh that gives you laboured, yet precise control of your rotund body in and out of the sweat-wringing efforts in craft or combat. It is hard to overstate how noticeable you are in a crowd, and since due to the recent history of the region that crowd can be composed almost exclusively of strapping or blubbery denizens, that is saying something, and you in all your fleshy, yet firmly powerful glory are an obvious go-to person for grim emergencies and lavish revelries both.

Your appearance becomes the talk of whatever town you choose to waddle in, and although even those who'd had time to get used to the rampant corpulence of the folks of these parts occasionally treat you to a bewildered stare, the gravity of your clearly harmless form most often warrants a warm welcome bordering on a massive celebration.

Around the city premises, your heavy steps often serve as a call for all sorts of sincere admirers and ingratiating sycophants, and your girthy form's confidence of bearing means that even the most chivalrous of disposition don't hesitate to hide behind your expansive back when the alarm bells ring.

Many unfamiliar folks find themsleves too overwhelmed by your rampantly fattened form to approach, instead preferring to warily study from afar with concern and pity in their stares, but the more flexibly-minded and aware individuals rush to greet and offer their services to you, realizing that in this realm, every pound of trembling fatty flesh that a person can accrue without getting waylaid by a crafty predator or burning it off at the gymnasium is worth its weight in gold, and by that standard you must be the most affluent and powerful $p.gentleman in the vicinity.

Your adventuring comrades in arms are proud to have a veritable war machine among their ranks, and your mellower town contacts always site your visits as a manifold blessing and an exalted honour, while those who have yet to earn your trust make a point of getting out of your way with all possible alacrity or humbly cheering you on from the sidelines.

Although the recent mysterious developments have made fuller physiques commonplace, the magnitude of your bountiful fleshiness leaves most of your new acquaintances shaking their heads in disbelief or gazing with rapt adoration, and while your perpetually exhausted appearance puts some at ease, it doesn't change the fact that you only ever get addressed by a stranger on rare occassions and in a nervous, overtly polite manner.

Since you've gone far beyond the boundaries of what even the most morbidly obese people should look like, it is understandably problematic for the townfolk to accept you as one of their own, but they are more then willing to applaud and praise you as an exceptional entity, especially since its quite clear that any friends of yours would be guaranteed both paramount degree of protection and - judging by your apparent appetite - an exclusive dining club membership.

						Just managing the maddening feat of harnessing the impetus of your overflowing dimensions in motion, you doggedly waddle towards the destination of your choice, and your staggering legs have tremendous thighs neither of which could fit into a town well, and that are squeezed together so tightly they prohibit your knees from getting anywhere close to each other; even the superbly portly calves below look slim in comparison to what hangs above. Your legs have very little in terms of power and flexibility to account for your unparalleled obesity, and even a simple thing like getting out of bed or climbing a set of stairs - something that an ordinarily-built person would have found trivial and mundane - turns into an arduous quest with all of its gruelling vexations, but the reward of staying on your feet despite the absurd enormity of your physique is worth the investment.
					<<case "bodybuilder">>
						Grass, sand, dirt and snow alike tremble at your ponderous advance, and even though you have left your capacity for springy acrobatics far behind and deep within, the tectonic inexorability of your pace in and out of combat never fails to impress, and your defiantly tough legs have bloated thighs neither of which could fit into a town well, and that are compressed together so hard that your knees are prevented from coming anywhere near each other; below, there are the firm, but inescapably lardaceous calves that are still humbled by the great bulks hanging above. Your legs are apparently as stubbornly unyielding as mountains, or else there would have been no secular, non-magical excuse for you to wander around as if you weren't as overwhelmingly overweight as you are, and it is often the shock of witnessing the maddening quickness of your frame that seals the fate of your adversaries, leaving them open to a flattening attack.

The sight of it lazily floating, with a serene kind of motion, is both captivating and surreal. The moment you reach out and hold the Aero Pearl in your hand, an unexpected sensation grips you. You feel a compelling urge to burp, as if the pearl is inducing spontaneous twinges of gas within you. This sensation, while not uncomfortable, is certainly unusual and unexpected, leaving you momentarily puzzled. The book mentions that its power will be unleashed by putting it in your mouth, but it’s concerningly vague about what exactly that means. The notion of placing such a strange and magical object in your mouth is daunting. The book's ambiguity about the pearl's effects only heightens your sense of concern and wonder. Will it bring about a physical transformation, grant some sort of power, or unleash something entirely unexpected? The possibilities seem endless and uncertain, adding to the allure and mystery of the Aero Pearl.",

You soon get your answer as you feel a building pressure in your mouth, and when you try to open your mouth to let it out, your jaw and lips seem to have locked shut. You hear a loud hiss ring out from inside your mouth and you feel air begin to force its way down into your stomach, having nowhere else to go, and your middle begins to swell out. You try to poke your fingers into your mouth to pry your mouth open, but your swollen fingers can’t get any leverage, and all you accomplish is accidentally swallowing the pearl. You feel it fall into your stomach. "
