Your belly swells out further and further, and you can feel the buoyancy within you making your entire body want to float to the surface. The $npc1.species senses this, and swims as best it can to the surface. $npc1.He puffs into you a few more times, before letting go and watching you glide away through the air. $npc1.He rolls onto $npc1.his belly and waves with $npc1.his tail as you drift away.

You have second thoughts and try to swim off, but as you do you feel $npc1.his jaws fix themselves around your ankles. You violently flail with your arms to try and escape, but you feel the $npc1.species let go before $npc1.he thrusts forward, biting further up your gut, before doing it again, and again. You can already feel your legs in $npc1.his stomach, and realise that escape is impossible, and give up once more. The $npc1.species works $npc1.his way over your chest, licking at your head before sucking it in and swallowing. You flop into $npc1.his rather spacious gut, which is surprisingly dry and somewhat comfortable. The $npc1.species lets out a burp and swims away back into the depths, and it’s a long while before your consciousness wanes.

The $npc1.species descends on you, blowing more bubbles into your mouth before $npc1.he even realises you’ve given up the fight. $npc1.He smiles, and gently bites your leg, pulling you down to the ocean floor before lying down on you, pinning you to the sandy floor. $npc1.He pins your arms down with $npc1.his fins, before rearing back and taking a huge intake of water. The lasting effects of the pills turn it into air as soon as it enters $npc1.his body, and you can see and hear $npc1.his middle swell up with air before $npc1.he locks lips with you, puffing air into your mouth like the most overenthusiastic act of CPR ever practiced, and your middle springs out with light gas. As your midriff becomes wider and wider, $npc1.he eventually doesn’t need to hold you down, due to the air pushing its way into your arms, making them unbendable and useless. You can see $npc1.him being lifted up by your rising stomach, eventually becoming vertical. $npc1.He’s so lost in $npc1.his enjoyment of the situation that $npc1.he’s rather startled when you become too big and $npc1.he rolls off of you. Unfortunately, $npc1.he was the only thing that was holding you down, and you begin to float up. $npc1.He quickly recovers and grabs you but your momentum towards the surface makes $npc1.his attempts to stop you futile. You break the surface, and the warm air within you catapults you into the air and makes you begin to drift back towards the shore. The $npc1.species surfaces, looking up at you drifting away, and you can see $npc1.him waving at you happily. There’s no malice or mocking in it – $npc1.he evidently thinks you enjoyed this as much as $npc1.he did. You feel pretty helpless as you’re carried away by the tidal breeze.

The constant pressure on your stomach is getting far too much to bear, becoming quite painful, but that’s the least of your concerns right now – You’re floating to the surface of the water and try as you might, you can’t swim back down. The $npc1.species giggles and swims over to you, either uncaring or unaware that you’re quite panicked by this lack of mobility, and locks lips with you, puffing a bit more air into your already overstretched body. $npc1.His contact with you only breaks when you’re lifted off the surface of the water completely and begin to drift off. The $npc1.species smiles, before diving back off into the water, treating this like the end of a game you two were playing and not an actual victory against you.

The left and right heads come to an agreement, as the middle one rolls its eyes. All three of them move to the ground and spit out the three they had eaten. As soon as their previous victims are released, the middle one darts forward and catches you in $npc1.his jaws before you have any chance to back out. $npc1.He flings her head back and swallows, sending you into a long trip down into the cavernous pit below.

The $npc1.species turns and leaves, glaring back at you. It might try to strike again while you’re not around.

The warmth coupled with the love of the $npc1.species is enthralling. You lean your cheek into the $npc1.species’s, nuzzling it in total, dopey bliss, and the feelings overwhelm you and you drift off to sleep. You awake from your long rest, and stretch a little, blinking the sleep out of your eyes... before you realise you can’t see anything – it’s totally dark. A small inspection of your surroundings confirms your suspicions – the $npc1.species fattened you up and ate you. At first, you feel kind of pleased about it, feeling glad $npc1.he’s happy, but this soon devolves into feelings of regret and sadness at $npc1.him betraying you like this. You begin to cry... before you feel something snap in your mind, and your senses come back. Your feelings of love for the $npc1.species and the memories of the last few minutes instantly vanish. You look around, and realise what happened again without the filter of the hypnosis clouding your judgement. You swear loudly at how easily you were duped, and try to wriggle free, but the long tube shape of the $npc1.species’s insides leave you unsure if you’re going towards or away from $npc1.his mouth.

Sure enough, a few moments later, another $npc1.species suddenly barges into the one you were fighting - The blood in the water acted like a $npc1.species magnet, and the two of them are squabbling with each other over you. Two $npc1.plural becomes four, then six, all ramming, fin-slapping and generally fighting over you in a manner that could only be more comical if there was a dust cloud building in the fight. You decide to take the chance to slink off, but as soon as you turn, you're greeted by the sight of a colossal, many-fanged mouth before everything goes black. Evidently, yet another $npc1.species noticed your predicament and went in for an easy meal. You would ordinarily struggle, but the rows of backwards-facing teeth put you off that idea, because they would slice you to ribbons if you tried to back out. The $npc1.species chomps its way over you, sucking in your legs and swallowing, burping in satisfaction as it quickly swims off before the others notice.

<<case "run succeed">>
<li>Escaped!</li>
You swim under the $npc1.species and then over it, in an attempt to confuse it to give you time to escape. It tries to follow you with its eyes by turning around in the water, and the momentum of its weight makes it spin feebly in the water, flailing a little. By the time $npc1.he's righted itself and shaken off the dizziness, you’re already gone.

<li>Run failed!</li>
You swim under the $npc1.species and then over it, in an attempt to confuse it and give you time to escape. It quickly rears downwards and slaps you with $npc1.his tail, knocking you away and winding you, making you have to go up for air. By the time you’ve done so the $npc1.species’s already righted itself and is back within attacking distance. 
<<enemyAction "attack">>


/*===Surrender===*/
<<case "submit">>
<li>Submit</li>
You don’t like the idea of continuing the fight and giving the $npc1.species more reason to bite and otherwise harm you, so you hold out your hand in a halting hand-sign, trying to stop the $npc1.species, wordlessly conveying that you no longer want to fight. The $npc1.species practically screeches to a halt, but bumps into you from $npc1.his inertia. $npc1.He pauses and looks at you, seeing if this is some sort of ploy, but soon opens its mouth wide, swims above you and darts down at you, getting to your waist before it stops, spins in the water so it’s facing up, and swallowing you as best it can. The teeth are thankfully not painful, due to them being backward-facing – They’d only hurt if you tried to tug yourself out. You enter the $npc1.species’s stomach, and soon the gentle sway of the $npc1.species swimming off on its way is enough to rock you to sleep.

The last hit from the $npc1.species takes the last of your strength from you, and you float to the surface of the water and pass out, with your head mercifully above water.

Your final attack sends the $npc1.species reeling backwards, rolling in the water so it ends belly up. $npc1.He flaps $npc1.his fin at you a few times in stunned desperation before it falls unconscious.
